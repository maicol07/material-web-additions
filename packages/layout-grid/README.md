> NOTE: The Material Web Components are distributed as ES2017 JavaScript Modules, and use the Custom Elements API. They are compatible with all modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and IE11, but an additional tooling step is required to resolve *bare module specifiers*, as well as transpilation and polyfills for Edge and IE11. See [here](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components#quick-start) for detailed instructions.
